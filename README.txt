-*- B-Spline Representation of Binary Images -*-
       By: Sasha Bakker and Ryan Errthum
------------------------------------------------

Project:

Description: This program takes a binary image as input, resizes it to (20%),
     and produces a figure for the skeletonized image with cubic B-splines
     fitted to the segmented skeleton branches.

Files: 'main_program.py', 'b_spline_functions.py', 'zhang_suen_functions.py'

Required Modules: cv2, numpy, math, scipy, matplotlib

Running the Project: 
    - Save binary images in the same folder as the project files
    - Open 'main_program.py' and change the variable `image_name` to the name
        of the binary image you wish to process.
    - Run 'main_program.py' in your IDE.
